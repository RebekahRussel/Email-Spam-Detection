Email spam continues to be one of the prevalent topics to be discussed in terms of the user’s
privacy, productivity and security. In this project, it targets to detect the spam emails by using
the Machine Learning Algorithms and techniques.
A number of classification algorithms such as the Logistic Regression, Naïve bayes, KNearest Algorithm, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier as well as the Regression
Algorithms which includes the Decision Tree Regression, Radiant Boosting Algorithm,
Support Vector Regressor are used to find the accuracy of the test data and the train data.
After checking the accuracy of the respective algorithms, the Model-2: Random Forest
Algorithm is selected to predict the spam or ham values of the data as it has the highest
accuracy score with an accuracy of 97.67%.
This developed system of the email-spam detection system helps the User to detect the
fraudulent emails by filtering the spam data which helps to recognize phishing and
unsolicited promotional contents.
